In 2009 I had pretty much stopped making art. Instead I was gardening, working with my brother-in-law Tim to make our big backyard into Eden.<br>&nbsp;<br> 
Gardening is like collaborating with nature. And no artist can match the beauty of flowers and trees. It’s environmental, kinetic and ever changing.<br>&nbsp;<br> 

But I also thought a sculpture might set off the landscaping nicely. And I had been invited to participate in a group show at the Beverly Art Center so I decide to make a big, ceramic, angry beaver.<br>&nbsp;<br>

I built preposterous interior structures in the beaver bottom to support the beaver top but these mainly just added weight and prevented the beast from drying evenly. I also made the bottom too big so the overall size of the sculpture had to increase to stay proportional.<br>&nbsp;<br>

					<h3 id="overlay-head4">Angry Beaver - Zen</h3>
			    <p id="overlay-body4" class="detail-text">I knew I had to build the thing at a certain rate to have any hope of completing it on time. So I would go down in the basement in the evening knowing I had to, say, complete the torso or add the arm. But the clay was soft and would sag. The overall shape was deviating from the maquette and becoming impossibly big, tilted and heavy. I ad libbed temporary wooden support structures.  Every night disaster seemed imminent. But somehow a miracle seemed to happen each night. <br>&nbsp;<br>
I knew this was not going to be a masterpiece, but I was enjoying the artistic, creative process. I was getting hooked into making art again. <br>&nbsp;<br>

			    <p id="overlay-body5" class="detail-text">The thing was cracking and ready to topple before I added the head, which would need to be huge, heavy and cantilevered out into space. And the head and face were the most critical bit to give the beaver its anger and character. Somehow this worked too.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Now I needed to get this incredibly unstable, 4ft, 500 lb monstrosity out of my basement, into a vehicle, and into a kiln. Again each step was aother miracle. For example, we had to rotate the top half 180 degrees from the bottom half to fit in the kiln, barely.<br>&nbsp;<br>

					<h3 id="overlay-head6">Angry Beaver - Fin</h3>
			    <p id="overlay-body6" class="detail-text">During the firing, you could hear the calamitous pinging of clay exploding. When we opened the kiln, it had many cracks but most of the exploding had been from the interior structure. The exterior was badly cracked but intact. I was able to get it home, patch the cracks with epoxy and paint over them.<br>&nbsp;<br>
The clay was barely cool when I brought it to the exhibit. For the opening I had my 7-year-old daughter bring tape and many paper letter “A”s. I tasked her and her friends to add an “A” to every Beverly Art Center sign in the building, transforming it to the Be<strong>a</strong>verly Art Center for the evening.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<!-- I start with just an empty file as a place holder in the animated gif. The real images will be asynchronous downloaded in the javascript. It will look for files named the same as the main images, i.e. "flower" with _anim.gif and _anim_loop.gif in the img folder, i.e. img/flower_anim_loop.gif. The js will swap the anim gif with the loop gif after the number of milisecons specified in the alt property (sorry about this!). 0 means no loop gif. -->
